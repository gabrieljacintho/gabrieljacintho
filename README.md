<h1 align="center">Hello, my name is Gabriel Bertasso! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" width="30px"></h1>

I'm a senior Unity game developer with +5 years of experience developing games with Unity Engine.

Throughout my career, I've worked on the development of +24 commercial projects, including mobile, PC and web games available on platforms such as Google Play Store, App Store, Steam, CrazyGames, and itch.io.

I've worked at game studios Pandora Game Studio and 67 Bits, and with publishers CreativeForge Games and Ritual Interactive.

I'm also the founder of FireRing Studio, a Brazilian horror game studio for PC and consoles.

My core skills include:
- Unity Engine: 2D, 3D, lighting, animation, IK, UI, audio, AI, ScriptableObjects, PlayerPrefs, Unity Cloud Services, Shader Graph, unit testing, Addressables, DOTS and many other features.
- C# programming language: Algorithms, data structure, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), code architecture, SOLID principles, asynchronous programming (async/await), game programming patterns, UML and code documentation.
- Git & GitHub: Creating repositories, fork, commit, branches, resolving merge conflicts, checkout, gitignore, gitattributes, LFS, tags, issues and releases.
- Clean and modular code: I write readable, simple, and concise code that is logically divided into functions and components.
- Performance optimization: I use profiling tools to identify the source of game performance issues, and various optimization techniques to solve them.
